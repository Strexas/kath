"""
Module for handling Socket.IO events related to workspace file exports.

This module sets up the event handler for the `WOKRSPACE_EXPORT_FEEDBACK_EVENT` event using
Socket.IO. It processes feedback about file export operations and sends appropriate real-time
feedback messages to the user's console based on the status of the export operation.

Imports:
    - socketio: The Socket.IO instance for handling real-time communication.
    - socketio_emit_to_user_session: Utility function for emitting messages to a user's session.
    - WOKRSPACE_EXPORT_FEEDBACK_EVENT: Constant defining the event name for file export feedback.
    - CONSOLE_FEEDBACK_EVENT: Constant defining the event name for console feedback.

Functions:
    - workspace_export_event_handler: Registers the Socket.IO event handler for file export
    feedback.

    Sets up the event handler for the `WOKRSPACE_EXPORT_FEEDBACK_EVENT` event in Socket.IO.

    This function registers an event handler for the `WOKRSPACE_EXPORT_FEEDBACK_EVENT` event,
    which is triggered during file export operations in the workspace. The event handler processes
    the feedback based on the status of the file export operation and sends appropriate feedback
    messages to the user's console.

    This function does not return any value. It directly interacts with the Socket.IO event system
    to provide real-time feedback to users.

    Side Effects:
        - Registers the `handle_workspace_export_feedback` function as an event handler for
          `WOKRSPACE_EXPORT_FEEDBACK_EVENT` using Socket.IO.

        the feedback based on the status provided in the event data. It then sends a message to the
