"""
This module is responsible for importing and registering all event modules within the application.

Event modules are imported to ensure that their event handlers are registered properly when the
application initializes.

It includes the registration of event handlers for Socket.IO events such as user connections and
disconnections.

Dependencies:
- src.events.workspace_event: An event module related to workspace operations, imported to ensure
    its event handlers are registered.

Functions:
- eventer: Registers event handlers for Socket.IO events. Specifically, it handles:
    - "connect": Called when a user connects. It registers the user's session and logs the
        connection.
    - "disconnect": Called when a user disconnects. It removes the user's session and logs the
        disconnection.
  
Details:
- `handle_connect`: Handles the connection event by extracting the UUID from the request,
    registering the user session with `socket_manager`, and logging the event.
- `handle_disconnect`: Handles the disconnection event by removing the user session from
    `socket_manager` and logging the event.

Logging:
- `logger`: Used to log connection and disconnection events, including error messages when no UUID
    is provided.
